# Python Tutorial
This is not a comprehensive Python tutorial but instead is intended to highlight the parts of the language that will be most important for us. You can download python form the [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). I recommend installing Anaconda distribution, which already includes most of the libraries that are need to do data science.

### Keep in mind
 * Python is very slow when written badly.
 * Translate C code into Python is often bad idea.
 * Pythonic solution sometimes result in drastic performance improvement.
 * Utilize libraries' capabilities more than you skill.

### Tutorial Includes
 * Python Basic : Basic python syntax and concept
 * Python Advance : Object Oriented Programming
 * Numpy Basic : Simple Numpy Operation
 * Pandas Basic : Simple Pandas Operation
 * MatplotLib : Line, Point, Bar Graph, Pie Chart
 * Scikit Learn : (Will be added later)

### Libraries required
This tutorial is written in Python-3 (Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Scikit-leanr). Anaconda already include all there libraries.
